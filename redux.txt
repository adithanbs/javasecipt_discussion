5. State the core principles of Redux.
The core principles of Redux are as follows:

Single source of truth: The global state of our application is always put away in an object tree inside one store.
The state is read-only: The only way to change the state of our application is by emitting an action, an object explaining what has happened.
Changes are made with pure functions: This principle means that in order to define how the state tree is being transformed by the actions, we have to write pure reducers.
